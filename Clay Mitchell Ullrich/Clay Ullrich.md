- Designed Lakehouse ingestion pipelines on AWS S3 & Aurora using Apache Iceberg and Apple Data Platform (ADP), enabling ACID analytics and cutting ETL cost by 35%.
- Orchestrated 1K+ daily data workflows with Netflix Conductor, integrating Controller, Registry, and Transformation services while enforcing metadata governance through Data Catalog & Data Portal.
- Integrated BERT-based NLP models via Ray distributed training and Weights & Biases experiment tracking; improved training throughput 4× and classification precision to 94%.
- Built feature-engineering on Apache Spark and streaming enrichment on Apache Flink–Druid stack powering sub-200 ms real-time recommendations.
- Instrumented ML observability with MLflow, Splunk, and Prometheus, cutting MTTR by 30% and ensuring SLA compliance.
- Authored REST/gRPC APIs with Spring Boot; deployed vector search on Milvus that lifted search CTR by 15%.
- Managed event-driven architecture with Kafka, Redpanda, and AWS Kinesis processing >3 TB/day; implemented CQRS and event-sourcing for audit-ready lineage.
- Containerized workloads with Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes (EKS) and automated delivery with Jenkins & GitHub Actions, achieving 20+ zero-downtime releases per day.
- Wrote Terraform & CloudFormation modules for multi-region disaster recovery and championed SRE best practices, attaining 99.95% service availability.
- Maintained MLData SDK Python library, standardizing data access patterns for feature engineering teams and reducing onboarding time by 50%.
- Implemented Apple Ray autoscaling clusters on Kubernetes to accelerate distributed hyperparameter tuning and reinforcement learning tasks.
- Optimized Apache Iceberg metadata compaction and snapshot pruning, improving table query latency by 22%.
- Configured AWS Aurora PostgreSQL for transactional workloads with read-replica promotion strategy, achieving 6× read throughput.
- Deployed S3 Intelligent-Tiering policies, saving $200K annually in storage costs for cold ML artifacts.
- Built Splunk dashboards and alerting for ML pipelines, providing proactive anomaly detection and 24/7 operational visibility.
- Developed Spark Structured Streaming jobs that backed near-real-time data marts consumed by ML features.
- Leveraged Flink CDC connectors to stream change-data capture from Aurora into Druid for sub-second insights.
- Extended Druid ingestion spec with rollup optimizations, cutting storage footprint by 30%.
- Established Lakehouse governance model linking Data Catalog lineage with Iceberg tables, ensuring GDPR compliance.
- Partnered with the security team to implement fine-grained data policies in ADP across Data Portal assets.
