# DLMM Oracle TWAP Project - Interview Preparation Guide

## Project Overview
**Project**: Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) with Oracle Integration and TWAP Implementation  
**Client**: Toshiko (SoraTech)  
**Technology Stack**: Solana, Rust, Anchor 0.29.x, Pyth Network, SPL Token  

## Key Project Requirements Understanding

### 1. DLMM Core Features
- **Bin Strategy**: System defaults to 70 bins per pool, expandable to 1400 bins
- **Dynamic Liquidity**: Automated liquidity allocation based on market conditions
- **Configurable Management**: Future-proof design with bin versioning support

### 2. Fee Structure Implementation
- **Max Fee Cap**: 10% (max_fee_bps = 1000)
- **Protocol Fee Share**: 5% of final dynamic fee (protocol_fee_share_bps = 500)
- **Dynamic Fee Calculation**: Based on volatility with configurable caps
- **Platform Fee Markup**: 40% markup on on-chain rent and transaction costs

### 3. Oracle Integration (Pyth Network)
- **Price Fetching**: Encapsulated in PriceFetcher helper abstraction
- **Timestamp Validation**: Delta between spot and TWAP ≤2 seconds
- **Confidence Threshold**: Reject if confidence/price > 1.5%
- **Staleness Check**: Reject if publish_time > 5 seconds
- **Status Validation**: Accept only if status == Trading

### 4. TWAP Implementation
- **Observation Buffer**: Ring buffer or sliding window approach
- **Deterministic Calculation**: Fixed interval queries (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Observation Recording**: Timestamp + tick + liquidity on every swap
- **Time-Weighted Averaging**: Across observation buffer

### 5. Event System & Output
- **PoolCreated Event**: Include vaults, mints, fees, and key fields
- **Structured Output**: Clear return values for off-chain syncing
- **Indexer Support**: Events for frontend display and analytics

### 6. Validation & Testing
- **Separate Validation**: validate_create_pool instruction for better UX
- **Test Plan**: Unit tests, integration tests, failure condition coverage
- **Time Estimates**: Implementation + testing hours breakdown

## Technical Deep-Dive Points

### Solana Program Architecture
```rust
// Key structures you should be able to discuss:
#[account]
pub struct Pool {
    pub vaults: Vec<Pubkey>,
    pub mints: Vec<Pubkey>,
    pub fees: PoolFees,
    pub bin_strategy: BinStrategy,
    pub oracle: Pubkey,
    pub twap_data: TwapData,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub struct PoolFees {
    pub max_fee_bps: u16,           // 10% cap
    pub protocol_fee_share_bps: u16, // 5% of dynamic fee
    pub dynamic_fee: u16,            // Volatility-based
}
```

### Pyth Network Integration
```rust
// Oracle price fetching with validation
pub fn get_validated_price(
    pyth_account: &Account<PythPrice>,
    current_timestamp: i64,
) -> Result<f64, Error> {
    // Check staleness (≤5 seconds)
    if current_timestamp - pyth_account.publish_time > 5 {
        return Err(Error::PriceTooStale);
    }
    
    // Check confidence threshold (≤1.5%)
    let confidence_ratio = pyth_account.confidence / pyth_account.price;
    if confidence_ratio > 0.015 {
        return Err(Error::PriceConfidenceTooLow);
    }
    
    // Check status
    if pyth_account.status != TradingStatus::Trading {
        return Err(Error::PriceNotTrading);
    }
    
    Ok(pyth_account.price)
}
```

### TWAP Calculation Engine
```rust
#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub struct Observation {
    pub timestamp: i64,
    pub tick: i64,
    pub liquidity: u128,
}

pub struct TwapCalculator {
    pub observations: VecDeque<Observation>, // Ring buffer
    pub interval: u64,                       // 30 seconds
}

impl TwapCalculator {
    pub fn get_twap(&self, current_time: i64) -> Result<f64, Error> {
        let target_time = current_time - self.interval;
        
        // Find observations around target time
        let (obs1, obs2) = self.find_observations(target_time)?;
        
        // Calculate time-weighted average
        let time_weight = (obs2.timestamp - obs1.timestamp) as f64;
        let price1 = self.tick_to_price(obs1.tick);
        let price2 = self.tick_to_price(obs2.tick);
        
        Ok((price1 + price2) / 2.0)
    }
}
```
